  - paragraph: We’ve had a family house in the district since 1983 and moved here permanently in 2000. The coastal lifestyle and the beauty of the beaches and the countryside are what we enjoy. We have three of our children working with us – it’s very special having a family business. We now also have two grandchildren who we see every day; it’s a perfect way to work and live.
  - paragraph: We are very keen swimmers and swim every morning in the ocean in front of our house. It’s a great start to the day. There are many good restaurants, producers and providores, so we go out for meals and do lots of cooking on the deck with the local seafood and produce. The weather is perfectly suited to outdoor entertainment.

  - paragraph: The beaches are absolutely stunning and there are so many to choose from. There are great surf breaks but also lovely places for a relaxing dip, or to try stand-up paddleboarding. Mollymook has one of the best golf courses on the South Coast for those who love to play and the Budawang Ranges are also right on our doorstep with many wonderful bush walks. Everyone who is able to must climb Pigeon House Mountain. The view is amazing.
  - paragraph: A few hidden gems? There are plenty of isolated beaches where you can be the only one walking on the sand. Aboriginal middens are found in some of the caves along these beaches and you can see evidence of activity that has been there for centuries. One thing I’m proud of is the friendliness of the locals and their ability to help you discover our wonderful district.

  - paragraph: "We have a lot of fabulous places to dine locally and our region is regarded as a food hub on the coast. Many restaurants stand out: Cupitt’s Estate offers fine food and al fresco casual dining in a stunning farm setting with live music every Sunday. Rick Stein’s at Bannisters, Tallwood Eatery in Mollymook and Small Town in Milton are all great for lunch and dinner, and Milkhaus in the hills behind Milton is perfect for breakfast. You can stay for a few days and have the choice of many good cafes and restaurants… Try them all if you can!"
  - paragraph: As for other wine regions in New South Wales, here are my favourites. Coolangatta Estate at Shoalhaven Heads makes some of the best wines in Australia and specialises in semillon. Their tempranillo is also delicious, as is the tannat.
  - paragraph: Murrumbateman/Bungendore near the <a class="js-close-modal link link--underlined link--color" href="{{site.baseurl}}/#canberra-district">Canberra District</a> has a lot of very good wineries. As a cool climate region there are good riesling, chardonnay, pinot noir and shiraz, as well as some terrific alternate varieties. Sangiovese, marsanne, roussanne, viognier, gruner veltliner are just a few varieties made well in the district. It’s my ‘go-to’ winery region.
