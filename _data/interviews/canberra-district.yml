  - paragraph: I am a sixth generation Canberran, from a long line of farmers and hoteliers.
  - paragraph: What drew my husband and I back to the region after living abroad was we loved the great open space and the lifestyle. An easy life to live, raise a family, and be happy. Lake George in NSW is well known for its mysterious lake, with its wonderful sunrises. We share the lake with thousands of kangaroos and each day looks different – every day we have regular animal encounters!

  - paragraph: We love to go bushwalking and taking the kids to experience new things. There are so many things to keep every family member entertained. When it’s hot, we can go for a swim in a billabong, when it’s cold, we can hit the ski fields or rug up next to the open fire and crack open one of our award-winning red wines. Hiking up our mountain and watching dawn break is pretty spectacular.
  - paragraph: Most cafes, abrs and restaurants are managed by the owner, and we’re always up for a good chat, about the weather or sport. One thing I love about Canberra is that at any one time you can head to a museum and enjoy a blockbuster, enjoy amazing food from every culture and enjoy Lake Burley Griffin as the sunsets. It’s really the bush capital, with so much beautiful flora and fauna everywhere.

  - paragraph: You don’t have to travel far to immerse yourself in the food culture of the region either. Grazing at Gundaroo is owned by a local award-winning chef and Kurt’s menu is seasonal. They only feature local wine on the list.
  - paragraph: We just love being in this industry and we share our passion with many others. We are loving Poachers Pantry, not only do they make the most amazing smoked meats, but their wines are so beautifully made.  They also have beautiful views across the vineyard and rolling hills!
  - paragraph: Our other love is the <a class="js-close-modal link link--underlined link--color" href="{{site.baseurl}}/#southern-highlands">Southern Highlands</a> Wine Region, where we enjoy calling into Cutaway Hill as Mark is such an amazing winemaker and is always up for a good yarn.
