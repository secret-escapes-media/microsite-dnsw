    - Tell us about how you ended up in Canberra District...
    - I am a sixth generation Canberran, I am from a long line of farmers and hoteliers.
    - What drew my husband and I back to the region after living elsewhere and abroad was we loved the great open space and the lifestyle. An easy life to live, raise a family, and be happy.  Lake George in NSW is well known for its mysterious lake, with its wonderful sunrises. We share the Lake with thousands of Kangaroos and each day looks different and every day we have regular animal encounters.

    - When you’re not busy at the vineyard, what would a typical bit of downtime look like in the region? What would you get up to?
    - We love to go bushwalking and taking the kids to experience new things. There are so many things to keep every family member entertained. When it’s hot, we can go for a swim in a billabong, when it’s cold, we can hit the ski fields or rug up next to the open fire and crack open one of our award-winning red wines.
  -
    - What would you recommend a new visitor to the region to not miss? What are the absolute must-dos?
    - Hiking up our Mountain and watching dawn break is pretty spectacular.
  -
    - Any hidden gems that really get under the skin of the region?
    - Most places are managed by the owner, and we’re always up for a good chat, about the weather or sport. One thing I love about Canberra is that at any one time you can head to a museum and enjoy a blockbuster, enjoy amazing food from every culture and enjoy Lake Burley Griffin as the sunsets. It’s really the bush capital with so much beautiful flora and fauna everywhere.
  -
    - Are there any restaurants or foodie things you could recommend?
    - You don’t have to travel far to immerse yourself in the food culture of the region. Grazing at Gundaroo is owned by a local award-winning chef and Kurt’s menu is seasonal. They only feature local wine on the list.
  -
    - What are some of your favourite other winemakers in the region?
    - We just love being in this industry and we share our passion with many others. We are loving Poachers Pantry, not only do they make the most amazing smoked meats, but their wines are so beautifully made.  Some beautiful views as well across the vineyard and rolling hills.
  -
    - Finally, what other region in New South Wales would you recommend to a wine lover and why?
    - We love the Southern Highlands Wine Region, and enjoy calling into Cutaway Hill as Mark is such an amazing winemaker and is always up for a good yarn.
