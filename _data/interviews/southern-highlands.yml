  - paragraph: I’ve been in the Southern Highlands for 24 years, and at the moment I’m the longest serving winemaker in the region. The landscape is what drew me here originally. The Southern Highlands is such a beautiful place to live. It has a fantastic climate, crisp fresh mornings, cool winters, and gentle warm summer days.

Some of the iconic places to visit in the Southern Highlands (outside of Cuttaway Hill and some of the other wineries!) are the International Bradman Museum in Bowral, iconic national parks where you can find Fitzroy Falls and Bundanoon and of course, our world-class restaurants.
