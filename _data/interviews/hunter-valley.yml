  - paragraph: I grew up and lived in Sydney for many years, but when the opportunity to join Brokenwood came along, I jumped at the chance.  The commute to work reduced from 1.25 hours to 2.5 minutes and no traffic lights! On the drive to work now I see clouds hanging over the Brokenback Ranges, kangaroos hopping around and beautiful rural vistas.  If I ever get frustrated at work, I walk out of the office and walk through the beautiful Graveyard Vineyard (the jewel in crown of Hunter Valley vineyards) and all the worries melt away.

  - paragraph: If I were to recommend anything to new visitors, one must-do is a visit to Brokenwood Wines new Cellar Door and enjoy lunch at The Wood Restaurant of course! Follow this with a walk in the Watagan Ranges, an afternoon nap and then an early meal at one of the many great restaurants (I love Bistro Molines at Mount View) which will enable you to get an early night so you’ll be ready for the balloon ride the next morning. My favourite producers that you should try have to be Binnorie Cheese, Lovedale Smokehouse and Artisan at Mount Pleasant! Also the Tinkler’s fresh seasonal produce, the Smelly Cheese Shop and Pukara Estate at Peppers Creek. For getting around in a unique way, Sutton Estate Electric Bike hire lets you pick up a bike and drop it off at many destinations around the Valley.

  - paragraph: Back to wine – the area is blessed with a new generation of family-owned wineries.  Stars ascending include Andrew Thomas Wines, Mike De Iuliis, and Dan Binet.
  - paragraph: If I had to recommend another wine region, it would have to be <a class="js-close-modal link link--underlined link--color" href="{{site.baseurl}}/#orange">Orange</a> – it has a great local-produce scene, beautiful cool climate chardonnay and pinot noir, hip accommodation and great coffee!
