    - Tell us about how you ended up in Hunter Valley...
    - I grew up and lived in Sydney for many years, but when the opportunity to join Brokenwood came along, I jumped at the chance. The commute to work reduced from 1.25 hours to 2.5 minutes and no traffic lights!  On the drive to work now I see clouds hanging over the Brokenback Ranges, kangaroos hopping around and beautiful rural vistas. If I ever get frustrated at work, I walk out of the office and walk through the beautiful Graveyard Vineyard (the jewel in crown of Hunter Valley Vineyards) and all the worries melt away.
  -
    - When you’re not busy at the vineyard, what would a typical bit of downtime look like in the region? What would you get up to?
    - Cooking fresh local produce with friends and enjoying a bottle or two of great Hunter Valley Wines, of course!
  -
    - What would you recommend a new visitor to the region to not miss? What are the absolute must-dos?
    - You must visit Brokenwood Wines new Cellar Door and enjoy lunch at The Wood Restaurant!
    - Then enjoy a walk in the Watagan Ranges, an afternoon nap and then an early meal at one of the many great restaurants (I love Bistro Molines at Mount View) which will enable you to get an early night so you’ll be ready for the balloon ride the next morning.
  -
    - Are there any restaurants or foodie things you could recommend?
    - The Provedores – Binnorie Cheese, Lovedale Smokehouse and Artisan at Mount Pleasant! Also the Tinkler’s fresh seasonal produce, the Smelly Cheese Shop and Pukhara Estate at Peppers Creek.
  -
    - Any particularly special outdoor adventures that people should know about?
    - Sutton Estate Electric Bike hire lets you pick up a bike and drop it off at many destinations around the Valley. Also fantastic is the Hunter Valley Zoo.
  -
    - What are some of your favourite other winemakers in the region?
    - The area is blessed with a new generation of family-owned wineries. Stars ascending include Andrew Thomas Wines, Mike De Iuliis, and Dan Binet.
  -
    - Finally, what other region in New South Wales would you recommend to a wine lover and why?
    - Head to Orange  - great local produce scene, beautiful cool climate Chardonnay and Pinot Noir, hip accommodation and great coffee!
