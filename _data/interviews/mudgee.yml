pull-quote: One great thing here is meeting all the producers; no other region in Australia does this as well because we just do it so naturally!

  - paragraph: I was born in Mudgee but moved away in 1971, only to return in 2000. I moved away to learn about wine, only to realise my connection to the farm was so strong I would have to adapt my learnings and make them work here. My wife and I go visit our friends in Orange who all have the same outlook about food, wine, and humour, there’s a real community spirit round here.

  - paragraph: If you’re visiting, I’d recommend checking out the national parks, which are an easy walk and a great drive. The scenery transforms every 5 kilometres where you go through rich farming land, then wind through hills with mountainous backdrops. A visit to Gulgong is a must because it is such a historic town. The Zin House (a farm-to-plate restaurant) is another favourite with great views to match.  The café culture is great because you engage with the locals.

  - paragraph: One great thing here is meeting all the producers; no other region in Australia does this as well because we just do it so naturally! There’s always a warm welcome around these parts. All the winemakers in the region are mates and I have had special support in some tough times from Jacob Stein and Peter Logan. Oatleys have been my big brother from time to time, and we have a strong relationship. It’s testament to the region that we all help each other out like this.
  - paragraph: If I could recommend another region it would have to be <a class="js-close-modal link link--underlined link--color" href="{{site.baseurl}}/#orange">Orange</a>; it has the best food. It is an easy drive after visiting Mudgee. They enjoy competition but always come second to Mudgee, and hate to admit it! I love the place, one big mountain and all the great agriculture that surrounds it. Mudgee is old school; Orange is more contemporary.
