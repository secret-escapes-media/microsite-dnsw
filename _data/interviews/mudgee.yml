    - Tell us about how you ended up in Mudgee...
    - I was born in Mudgee but moved away in 1971, only to return in 2000. I moved away to learn about wine then realised that the farm, the connection was so strong I would adapt what I learnt from afield to a venture that I would love to do.
  -
    - When you’re not busy at the vineyard, what would a typical bit of downtime look like in the region? What would you get up to?
    - My wife and I go visit our friends in Orange who all have the same outlook about food, wine and humour, and we set out to solve the world's problems and then we create our own for us all to have some homework for next time.
  -
    - What would you recommend a new visitor to the region to not miss?
    - The national parks are an easy walk and a great drive. The café culture is great because you engage with the locals. The scenery transforms every 5 kms where you go through rich farming land, then wind through hills with mountain or big hill backdrops.  A visit to Gulgong because it is such a historic town.
  -
    - What are the absolute must-dos?
    - The zin house is 20 m from a beautiful food garden, spectacular views. Castle rock walk at the national park. Chasing kangaroos on the back of a utility, to see how fast they go.
  -
    - Any hidden gems that really get under the skin of the region?
    - Meeting all the producers, no other region in Australia does this as well because we do it naturally. No one is dressed fashionably just appropriately. We are pleased to see people.
  -
    - Are there any restaurants or foodie things you could recommend?
    - Zin house (my wife’s), Mr Sushi were we go every Wednesday for the sushi train. All the locals go there.
  -
    - What are some of your favourite other winemakers in the region?
    - All the winemakers in the region are mates, I have had special support in some tough times from Jacob Stein and Peter Logan. Oatleys have been my big brother from time to time, and we have a strong relationship
  -
    - Finally, what other region in New South Wales would you recommend to a wine lover and why?
    - Orange; as its got its food right. It is a natural next drive once you have been to Mudgee. They enjoy competition but always come second to Mudgee, but hate to admit it. I love the place, 1 big mountain and all the great agriculture that surrounds it. It’s a new place where Mudgee is old Orange is more contemporary.
