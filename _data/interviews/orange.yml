    - Tell us about how you ended up in Orange...
    - After a number of years searching the perfect location to establish our wine label we settled on Orange 20 years ago - one of Australia’s best wine regions. The nature of the property and the beauty of the surrounding countryside made it the perfect place to establish our vineyard and create a family home. Orange’s high altitude and cool climate make it ideal for viticulture.
    - As a region synonymous with great food (Orange is home to Australia’s longest-running food festival) there are numerous fine dining restaurants, local cafes and casual eats – all with a focus on locally sourced produce.
    - I really enjoy the pace and authenticity of this rural region.
  -
    - When you’re not busy at the vineyard, what would a typical bit of downtime look like in the region? What would you get up to?
    - Orange’s flourishing cosmopolitan lifestyle means there is always something to do. Whether it is seeking out live music at venue such as the Agrestic Grocer, shopping the many boutique fashion and homeware stores or relaxing with friends over a long lunch at one of the regions bars or restaurants.
    - Mount Canobolas is great for walking. Big views and an abundance of wildlife offer a peaceful escape. To cool off and relax in summer we head to Lake Canobolas for a picnic and swim.
  -
    - What would you recommend a new visitor to the region to not miss? What are the absolute must-dos?
    - Visit a farmgate for a truly authentic experience. Shop like a local by visiting one of the many producers in the region to buy directly from the grower. Many of our local farmers offer a pick-your-own-fruit experience including Hillside Harvest, Thornbrook Orchard and Huntley Berry Farm.
  -
    - Any hidden gems that really get under the skin of the region?
    - Experiencing a hot air balloon ride is an exhilarating experience. Watch the sunrise as you float effortlessly over the beautiful countryside.
    - Hit the road and discover what makes up the rich tapestry of our community. Discover the character of Orange’s surrounding villages, each with their own distinct landscapes, flavours and colourful histories. Rustic cellar doors, meandering country lanes and fine dining with warm country hospitality.
  -
    - Are there any restaurants or foodie things you could recommend?
    - Dinner at Sister’s Rock Restaurant at Borrodell Estate is a must-do. This farm-to-table restaurant is located in the heart of the estate’s vineyards, orchards and trufferie with fabulous views.
  -
    - Any particularly special outdoor adventures that people should know about?
    - The majestic Mount Canobolas is a dormant volcano that formed millions of years ago when Australia was sitting over a hotspot in the earth's crust. It is part of the Brigooda-Oberon chain that stretches 800km from southeast Queensland to near Oberon in NSW and last erupted eleven million years ago. With its rich soil, high altitude and cool climate, it’s the perfect environment to see the region’s native plants and animals up close.
  -
    - What are some of your favourite other winemakers in the region?
    - De Salis is a small, family winery located at an altitude of 1050 meters on the northern slope of Mount Canobolas. Their minimalist winemaking philosophy capture’s the seasonal ebb and flow of the region and their vineyard. I am big fan of their classic, traditional method sparkling wines.
    - One of Australia’s most celebrated winemakers, Philip Shaw, established his vineyard in Orange back in 1989. Today, this family-owned and operated winery also features a stunning tasting room cantered around a restored turn-of-the-century stone barn and landscaped gardens. The wines here have a bright fruit flavour with elegance and complexity.
  -
    - Finally, what other region in New South Wales would you recommend to a wine lover and why?
    - Even though it is called the Canberra Wine Region, many of the region’s vineyards and cellar door are actually located in New South Wales. I am a big fan of many of the producers in the Yass Valley, particularly in and around Murrumbateman, for outstanding Shiraz and Riesling, along with a range of emerging alternative wine varietals.
