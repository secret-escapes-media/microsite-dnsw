  - paragraph: After a number of years searching for the perfect location to establish our wine label we settled on Orange 20 years ago – one of Australia’s best wine regions. The nature of the property and the beauty of the surrounding countryside made it the perfect place to establish our vineyard and create a family home. Orange’s high altitude and cool climate make it ideal for viticulture.

  - paragraph: Orange’s flourishing cosmopolitan lifestyle means there is always something to do. As a region synonymous with great food (Orange is home to Australia’s longest-running food festival, Orange F.O.O.D. Week) there are numerous fine dining restaurants, local cafes and casual eats – all with a focus on locally sourced produce. Whether it is seeking out live music at venues like the Agrestic Grocer, shopping the many boutique fashion and homeware stores or relaxing with friends over a long lunch at one of the region's bars or restaurants, Orange has a diverse set of offerings.
  - paragraph: Mount Canobolas is great for walking. Big views and an abundance of wildlife offer a peaceful escape. To cool off and relax in summer we head to Lake Canobolas for a picnic and swim. Visit a farmgate for a truly authentic experience. Shop like a local by visiting one of the many producers in the region to buy directly from the grower. Many of our local farmers offer a pick-your-own-fruit experience including Hillside Harvest, Thornbrook Orchard and Huntley Berry Farm.

  - paragraph: See the whole region in one go – a hot air balloon ride is an exhilarating experience. Watch the sunrise as you float effortlessly over the beautiful countryside.
  - paragraph: Back down on earth, hit the road and discover what makes up the rich tapestry of our community. Discover the character of Orange’s surrounding villages, each with their own distinct landscapes, flavours and colourful histories. Rustic cellar doors, meandering country lanes and fine dining with warm country hospitality.
  - paragraph: Dinner at Sister’s Rock Restaurant at Borrodell Estate is a must-do. This farm-to-table restaurant is located in the heart of the estate’s vineyards, orchards and trufferie with fabulous views.
  - paragraph: Other top estates include De Salis, a small, family winery located at an altitude of 1050 metres on the northern slope of Mount Canobolas. Their minimalist winemaking philosophy captures the seasonal ebb and flow of the region and their vineyard. I am a big fan of their classic, traditional-method sparkling wines.
  - paragraph: One of Australia’s most celebrated winemakers, Philip Shaw, established his vineyard in Orange back in 1989. Today, this family-owned and operated winery also features a stunning tasting room centered around a restored turn-of-the-century stone barn and landscaped gardens. The wines here have a bright fruit flavour with elegance and complexity.
  - paragraph: Outside of Orange, I’d have to recommend the <a class="js-close-modal link link--underlined link--color" href="{{site.baseurl}}/#canberra-district">Canberra</a> Wine Region. I am a big fan of many of the producers in the Yass Valley, particularly in and around Murrumbateman, for outstanding shiraz and riesling, along with a range of emerging alternative wine varietals.
